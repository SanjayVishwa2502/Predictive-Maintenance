# Example: Refined TVAE models
# This directory contains models refined using transfer learning

# Example structure:
# motor_siemens_001/
#   ├── original_tvae.pkl         # Original model (seed-trained)
#   ├── refined_tvae.pkl          # Refined model (real-data trained)
#   ├── training_comparison.json  # Loss curves comparison
#   └── refinement_config.json    # Epochs, learning rate, freeze_encoder

# Refinement approach:
# 1. Load existing TVAE model (seed-trained)
# 2. Continue training on real/merged data
# 3. Use 10x lower learning rate (0.0001 vs 0.001)
# 4. Train for fewer epochs (50-100 vs 300)
# 5. Early stopping if loss plateaus

# Quality metrics:
# - Loss reduction vs original model
# - KL-divergence vs real data
# - Correlation matrix comparison
