# Example: Augmented datasets
# This directory contains large synthetic datasets generated from refined models

# Example structure:
# motor_siemens_001/
#   ├── train.parquet             # 35,000 samples (70%)
#   ├── val.parquet               # 7,500 samples (15%)
#   ├── test.parquet              # 7,500 samples (15%)
#   └── augmentation_config.json  # Model used, generation timestamp

# Use case:
# Start with 500 real samples → Refine TVAE → Generate 50,000 augmented samples

# Quality checks:
# - Temporal structure preserved (RUL decreasing)
# - Sensor correlations maintained
# - Distribution matches real data
# - Passes same validation as seed data
